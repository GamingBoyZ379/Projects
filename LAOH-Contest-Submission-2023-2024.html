    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Countess_Constance_Markiewicz-1.1.2_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Countess_Constance_Markiewicz-1.1.2_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="Constance Markievicz">
    <p>Constance Markievicz was born February 4, 1868, in London, England and she died July 15, 1927, Dublin, Ireland</p>
    <p>Markievicz's involvement in the Easter Rising of 1916 marked a turning point in her life. She fought alongside her fellow Irish republicans, enduring hardships and dangers in pursuit of a free Ireland. Her dedication to the cause extended beyond the battlefield; she was a co-founder of Cumann na mBan, a women's republican organization.</p>
    <p>Markievicz's legacy as a feminist and revolutionary remains influential, and her story serves as a reminder of the strength of character and determination that can shape history.</p>
