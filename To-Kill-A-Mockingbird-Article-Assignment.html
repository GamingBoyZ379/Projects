 <p>Great Depression, worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted until about 1939.</p>
 
 <h2>It was the longest and most severe depression ever experienced by the industrialized Western world</h2>
<p>Virtually every industrialized country endured declines in wholesale prices of 30 percent or more</p>
 <p>The fundamental cause of the Great Depression in the United States was a decline in spending which led to a decline in production as manufacturers and merchandisers noticed an unintended rise in inventories</p>
 <p>As much as one-fourth of the labour force in industrialized countries was unable to find work in the early 1930s</p>
 <p>Between the peak and the trough of the downturn, industrial production in the United States declined 47 percent</p>
